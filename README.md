# TestSpace
Android App developed for Oculus Quest. User wears a VR HMD and explores their physical environment. 
User does not have controllers, instead game space is mapped directly to physical space, allowing
triggers to be hit by the user's movement. 

The position of the headset is tracked and used to output audio wirelessly to a 7.1 surround system. 
This allows the user to manipulate the audio based on their position and movement.
